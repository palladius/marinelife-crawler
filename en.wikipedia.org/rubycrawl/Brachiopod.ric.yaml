latin_name: ''
proper-description: "Brachiopods (/ˈbrækioʊˌpɒd/), phylum Brachiopoda, are a phylum
  of trochozoan animals that have hard \"valves\" (shells) on the upper and lower
  surfaces, unlike the left and right arrangement in bivalve molluscs. Brachiopod
  valves are hinged at the rear end, while the front can be opened for feeding or
  closed for protection. Two major categories are traditionally recognized, articulate
  and inarticulate brachiopods. The word \"articulate\" is used to describe the tooth-and-groove
  structures of the valve-hinge which is present in the articulate group, and absent
  from the inarticulate group. This is the leading diagnostic skeletal feature, by
  which the two main groups can be readily distinguished as fossils. Articulate brachiopods
  have toothed hinges and simple, vertically-oriented opening and closing muscles.
  Conversely, inarticulate brachiopods have weak, untoothed hinges and a more complex
  system of vertical and oblique (diagonal) muscles used to keep the two valves aligned.
  In many brachiopods, a stalk-like pedicle projects from an opening near the hinge
  of one of the valves, known as the pedicle or ventral valve. The pedicle, when present,
  keeps the animal anchored to the seabed but clear of sediment which would obstruct
  the opening.\n\nBrachiopod lifespans range from three to over thirty years. Ripe
  gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit
  into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are miniature adults,
  with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals
  become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate
  species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like blobs with yolk sacs, and
  remain among the plankton for only a few days before leaving the water column upon
  metamorphosing.\n\nWhile traditional classification of brachiopods separate them
  into distinct inarticulate and articulate groups, two approaches appeared in the
  1990s. One approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods,
  since both use layers of calcareous minerals their shell; the other approach considers
  the Craniida to be a separate third group, as their outer organic layer is distinct
  from that of both the linguliforms (\"typical\" inarticulates) and rhynchonelliforms
  (articulates). However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher
  levels of classification such as order and recommend a bottom-up approach that identifies
  genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods
  have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a
  superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the
  evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes
  while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or
  the deuterostomes.\n\nIt was suggested in 2003 that brachiopods had evolved from
  an ancestor similar to Halkieria, a slug-like Cambrian animal with \"chain mail\"
  on its back and a shell at the front and rear end; it was thought that the ancestral
  brachiopod converted its shells into a pair of valves by folding the rear part of
  its body under its front. However, new fossils found in 2007 and 2008 showed that
  the \"chain mail\" of tommotiids formed the tube of a sessile animal; one tommotiid
  resembled phoronids, which are close relatives or a subgroup of brachiopods, while
  the other tommotiid bore two symmetrical plates that might be an early form of brachiopod
  valves. Lineages of brachiopods that have both fossil and extant taxa appeared in
  the early Cambrian, Ordovician, and Carboniferous periods, respectively.[3] Other
  lineages have arisen and then become extinct, sometimes during severe mass extinctions.
  At their peak in the Paleozoic era, the brachiopods were among the most abundant
  filter-feeders and reef-builders, and occupied other ecological niches, including
  swimming in the jet-propulsion style of scallops. Brachiopod fossils have been useful
  indicators of climate changes during the Paleozoic. However, after the Permian–Triassic
  extinction event, brachiopods recovered only a third of their former diversity.
  A study in 2007 concluded the brachiopods were especially vulnerable to the Permian–Triassic
  extinction, as they built calcareous hard parts (made of calcium carbonate) and
  had low metabolic rates and weak respiratory systems. It was often thought that
  brachiopods went into decline after the Permian–Triassic extinction, and were out-competed
  by bivalves, but a study in 1980 found both brachiopod and bivalve species increased
  from the Paleozoic to modern times, with bivalves increasing faster; after the Permian–Triassic
  extinction, brachiopods became for the first time less diverse than bivalves.\n\nBrachiopods
  live only in the sea, and most species avoid locations with strong currents or waves.
  The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in
  well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim for up to a month
  and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish
  and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them.
  Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.[4]) have been fished commercially,
  on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure
  of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the
  shore of the Sea of Japan. The word \"brachiopod\" is formed from the Ancient Greek
  words brachion (\"arm\") and podos (\"foot\").[5] They are often known as \"lamp
  shells\", since the curved shells of the class Terebratulida resemble pottery oil-lamps.[2]\n\nBrachiopods
  are the state fossil of the U.S. state of Kentucky.[6] \n\n"
