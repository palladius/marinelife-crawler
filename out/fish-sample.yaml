    Order: ''
  fish_local_url_name: samples//Anglerfish

  latin_name: ''
  proper-description: "The anglerfish are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes (/ˌlɒfiɪˈfɔːrmiːz/).[1]
    They are bony fish named for their characteristic mode of predation, in which
    a modified luminescent fin ray (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure for other
    fish. The luminescence comes from symbiotic bacteria, which are thought to be
    acquired from seawater,[2][3] that dwell in and around the sea. \n\nSome anglerfish
    are notable for extreme sexual dimorphism and sexual symbiosis of the small male
    with the much larger female, seen in the suborder Ceratioidei, the deep sea anglerfish.
    In these species, males may be several orders of magnitude smaller than females.[4]\n\nAnglerfish
    occur worldwide. Some are pelagic (dwelling away from the sea floor), while others
    are benthic (dwelling close to the sea floor). Some live in the deep sea (such
    as the Ceratiidae), while others on the continental shelf, such as the frogfishes
    and the Lophiidae (monkfish or goosefish). Pelagic forms are most often laterally
    compressed, whereas the benthic forms are often extremely dorsoventrally compressed
    (depressed), often with large upward-pointing mouths.[citation needed]\n\n"

  proper-description: |+
    The archerfish (spinner fish or archer fish) form a monotypic family, Toxotidae, of fish known for their habit of preying on land-based insects and other small animals by shooting them down with water droplets from their specialized mouths.  The family is small, consisting of ten species in a single genus Toxotes.  Most species live in fresh water rivers, streams and pools, but two or three are euryhaline, inhabiting both fresh and brackish water habitats such as estuaries and mangroves.[1][2] They can be found from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, through Southeast Asia, to Northern Australia and Melanesia.[3]

    Archerfish or spinnerfish bodies are deep and laterally compressed, with the dorsal fin, and the profile a straight line from dorsal fin to mouth. The mouth is protractile, and the lower jaw juts out. Sizes are fairly small, typically up to about 12–18 cm (5–7 in), but T. chatareus can reach 40 cm (16 in).[3][4]

    Archerfish are popular for aquaria,[5] but difficult to feed since they prefer live prey.

  proper-description: |+
    The Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), also known as the Queensland lungfish, Burnett salmon and barramunda, is the only surviving member of the family Neoceratodontidae. It is one of only six extant lungfish species in the world. Endemic to Australia,[7] the Neoceratodontidae are an ancient family belonging to the class Sarcopterygii, or lobe-finned fishes.[8]

    Fossil records of this group date back 380 million years, around the time when the higher vertebrate classes were beginning to evolve.[9]  Fossils of lungfish almost identical to this species have been uncovered in northern New South Wales, indicating that Neoceratodus has remained virtually unchanged for well over 100 million years, making it a living fossil and one of the oldest living vertebrate genera on the planet.[9]

    It is one of six extant representatives of the ancient air-breathing Dipnoi (lungfishes) that flourished during the Devonian period (about 413–365 million years ago) and is the outgroup to all other members of this lineage.[9][10]
    The five other freshwater lungfish species, four in Africa and one in South America, are very different morphologically from N. forsteri.[9] The Queensland lungfish can live for several days out of the water, if it is kept moist, but will not survive total water depletion, unlike its African counterparts.[7]

    The small settlement of Ceratodus, Queensland derives its name from that of the Australian lungfish. The species was named in honour of the squatter and politician William Forster.[11]

    The Azores dogfish (Scymnodalatias garricki) is a very rare sleeper shark of the family Somniosidae. It is known only from the holotype caught north of the Azores and another caught in 2001.

    The Azores dogfish lives in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean at depths of 300-2000m. Like most sharks, it is ovoviviparous.[2]

    The bareskin dogfish (Centroscyllium kamoharai) is a little-known, deepwater dogfish shark of the family Etmopteridae.[1][2] This species is found in the western Pacific from southern Japan to western and southeastern Australia as well as in New Zealand waters.[3]

    The bareskin dogfish has no anal fin. It has grooved dorsal spines with the second larger than the first, a smaller first dorsal fin, blunt nose, large eyes, large nostrils, widely spaced and sparse denticles, and is dark in color with white-tipped fins. It is stout and grows to a maximum of 40 cm.[4][5]  Like other species in the family Etmopteridae (lanternsharks), the bareskin dogfish has a bioluminescent organ on the ventral side.  However, perhaps owing to the depth at which the species lives, it has relatively fewer photophores on its ventral skin than others bioluminescent sharks.[6]

    The beardfishes consist of a single extant genus, Polymixia, of deep-sea marine ray-finned fish named for their pair of long hyoid barbels. They are classified in their own order Polymixiiformes /pɒliˈmɪksi.ɪfɔːrmiːz/.[1] But as Nelson says, "few groups have been shifted back and forth as frequently as this one, and they were recently added to Paracanthoptergii".[2] For instance, they have previously been classified as belonging to the Beryciformes.  They are of little economic importance.[3]

    They are found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific Ocean. They are bottom-dwelling fish, found down to about 800 m (2,600 ft) depth. Most are relatively small fish, although one species, Polymixia berndti, is over 40 cm (16 in) in length.[3]

    The term billfish refers to a group of saltwater predatory fish characterised by prominent pointed bills (rostra), and by their large size; some are longer than 4 m (13 ft). Extant billfish include sailfish and marlin, which make up the family Istiophoridae; and swordfish, sole member of the family Xiphiidae. They are apex predators which feed on a wide variety of smaller fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. These two families are sometimes classified as belonging to the order Istiophoriformes, a group which originated around 71 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous, with the two families diverging around 15 million years ago in the Late Miocene.[3] However, they are also classified as being closely related to the mackerels and tuna within the suborder Scombroidei of the order Perciformes.[4] However, the 5th edition of the Fishes of the World does recognise the Istiophoriformes as a valid order, albeit including the Sphyraenidae, the barracudas.[5]

    Billfish are pelagic and highly migratory, and are found in all oceans,[6] although they usually inhabit tropical and subtropical waters; swordfish are found in temperate waters, as well.  Billfish use their long spear/sword-like upper beaks to slash at and stun prey during feeding. Their bills can also be used to thrust prey, and have been known to impale boats (probably accidentally), but they are not normally used in that way. They are highly valued as game fish by sports fishermen.
